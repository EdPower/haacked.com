![](/assets/images/BirthdayCake.jpg "Birthday cake")I know the timing is pretty
crummy, but here it is. It is required, yes **required**, that I give
you a true geek birthday salute (i.e. a blog birthday greeting).

Happy birthday love!

p.s. Yes, that cake is an ice-cream cake (my wife is allergic to eggs
and anything made with eggs).
