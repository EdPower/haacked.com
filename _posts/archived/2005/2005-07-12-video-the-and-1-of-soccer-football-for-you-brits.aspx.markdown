![Soccer Video](https://haacked.com/assets/images/SoccerVideo.jpg) This is one
of the [freshest soccer
videos](http://www.putfile.com/media.php?n=fussball) I’ve ever seen. All
moves that were obviously copied from poachers watching me on the pitch.
In a way, this is like those fancy “And 1” basketball videos, except
these moves are all legal... and it’s soccer.

UPDATE: I guess it helps if I actually link to the damn video.
