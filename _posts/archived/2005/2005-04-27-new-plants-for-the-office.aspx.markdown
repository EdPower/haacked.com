This past weekend Akumi and I headed over to the downtown flower mart to
purchase some plants. We came home with a couple money trees and some
bamboo for my office.

There's something about Bamboo that is very soothing for me. Sometimes
if I look at it long enough, I can swear that the leaves are moving
gracefully, twisting upwards.
