![The Shining](https://haacked.com/assets/images/TheShining.jpg) Since when was
*The Shining* a feel good movie? Since somebody creatively edited
footage to make [this
promo](http://waxy.org/random/video/shining_redux.mov).

After watching this, consider whether you’re really getting the
“reality” in Reality shows. If they want Omarosa to be a bitch, oh yes,
she’ll be a BITCH. If they want someone to be a hero, they can make it
happen.

Behold the power of film editors!
