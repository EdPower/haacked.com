In the Subtext 1.5 release announcement, I mentioned we had a few new
skins. I thought I would post a couple of screenshots of the Submarine
skin to give you a sense of what it looks like.

And here is a detail shot.

One problem with this skin is that it is fairly narrow for a fixed width
skin. Hopefully we can fix that in the next version and offer a few more
intriguing skins.

Be sure to check out these skins as well **KeyWest**, **Semagogy**,
**Piyo**, **WPSkin**. I think some of them are new, but I cannot
remember.

Also, if you have some sweet design skills, we are always looking for
new skins to add to the default installation.
