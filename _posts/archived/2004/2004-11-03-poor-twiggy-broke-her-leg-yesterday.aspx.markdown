![Twiggy](/assets/images/LittleTwiggy.jpg) Twiggy was at a newly opened small
dog park when a group of other small dogs suddenly ganged up on her. Of
course they couldn't catch her because she's a speed demon, but she must
have caught her foot in a grate on the ground (extremely bad idea for a
small dog park to have a grate on the ground) and broke her leg just
above her ankle.

She's at the vet now and is doing fine. If you have a pet that you care
for, I recommend getting pet insurance. I hear it's not too expensive
and could save you a pretty dime in a situation like this. We were
planning to purchase it but just hadn't gotten around to it. Now we have
a significant vet bill to pay.

Hopefully we can pick her up today or tomorrow.
