UPDATE: [The new name is
NuGet](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/10/29/nupack-is-now-nuget.aspx "NuPack renamed")

**The NuPack project is undergoing a rename and we need your help!**

What is the new name?
---------------------

We don’t know. You tell us! The NuPack project team brainstormed a set
of names and narrowed down the list to four names.

I’ve posted a set of names as issues in our NuPack CodePlex.com site and
will ask you to vote for your favorite name among the lot. Vote for as
many as you want, but realize that if you vote for all of them, you’ve
just cancelled your vote. ![Winking
