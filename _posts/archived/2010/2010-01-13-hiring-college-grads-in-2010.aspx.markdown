This is the second job posting in two days for positions on the ASP.NET
team, how exciting! This one is a developer position for upcoming
graduates.

Before I continue, I need to fulfill a promise to a co-worker to include
a barely relevant stock photograph in this blog post.

Good, with that out of the way, allow me to continue.

**If you are in college or grad school, graduating in 2010, and are
looking for a great job writing code for ASP.NET, we have a position
available!**  Send me your resume and I’ll forward it along to the
proper people.

My email address is philha at (my company).com where (my company) is
Microsoft. If you can’t figure out based on that where to email your
resume, you probably shouldn’t bother applying ;)

Once again, this is for college or graduate school students graduating
in 2010. If you’re not an upcoming graduate, consider we also have [a QA
position
available](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/01/13/aspnet-team-is-hiring-qa.aspx "QA Position").

I look forward to seeing you roam the halls of building 42.
