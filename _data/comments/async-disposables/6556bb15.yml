  Thanks for sharing.



  I sometimes find it useful that Rx's disposables are always idempotent - every call to Dispose except the first one is a no-op (see https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/blob/118476bec440f5ae2a916f8ca2010422a9935c5a/Rx.NET/Source/src/System.Reactive/Disposables/AnonymousDisposable.cs#L37).



  Also, is there a reason that AddReactionAsync doesn't return an IAsyncDisposable right away? I find it good practice that when doing something I get back something to undo it. So undoing is basically not possible without doing it. And there's no need to lookup the undo action.
