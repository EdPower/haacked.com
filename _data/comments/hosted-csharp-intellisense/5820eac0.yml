message: Hi thank you! Is there a way to have into the csx the host object passed from CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<int>(code, opt, host) and have the intellisense on it in vscode? Via host object the script can interact with main application (CAD in my case, for exampe draw geometries). Thank you very much
