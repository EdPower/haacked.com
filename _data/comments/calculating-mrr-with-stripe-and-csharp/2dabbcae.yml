  Is this different than Stripe Metrics export? https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/view-metrics#metrics-export



  The metrics export includes MRR per subscriber per month and MRR roll-forward, active subscriber roll-forward, etc.



  Regardless, this is a great walkthrough! And I agree, Stripe support is awesome.
