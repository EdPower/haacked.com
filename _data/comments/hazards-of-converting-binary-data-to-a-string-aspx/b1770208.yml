message: I'm a very experienced developer, and I fell victim to this same problem. I'm trying to save DICOM attributes (mixture of datatypes) into CSV. At first I tried unicode, utf-8, cp 437, cp 1252... they all failed! Some earlier than others, but none survived the round trip to the file and back. Suddenly I realized "hey, that's not what codepages are for", and switched to base64
